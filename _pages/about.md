<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Xinru Yang, I also go by Isabella. Currently I am a software engineer at Google, working on large language modeling on <a href='https://labs.google/sge/'>Search Generative Experience (SGE)</a> in Search. 

Before joining Google, I obtained the Master of Language Technologies from Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I was fortunately fully sponsored during my 24-month master program and advised by <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alex/'>Alexander G. Hauptmann</a>.

Broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I have diverse academia / industrial experiences in natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, reinforcement learning, recommendation system, etc.

Deeply passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship, I am also very active in helping early-stage founders shape their ideas and find product market fit, by providing technical support and financial advisory. Book a slot for a quick chat on my <a href='https://calendly.com/isabella-y/15min'>calendar</a> if you have something exciting to share!
