<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Xinru Yang. Currently I am a software engineer at Google/YouTube, working on multimodal large language model. My prior work includes <a href='https://labs.google/sge/'>Search Generative Experience (SGE)</a> in Search. 

Before joining Google, I obtained the Master of Language Technologies from Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I was fortunately fully sponsored during my 24-month master program and advised by <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alex/'>Alexander G. Hauptmann</a>.

Broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I have diverse academia / industrial internships in University of California, Irvine, Microsoft Research Asia, and Alibaba on natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, reinforcement learning, recommendation system, etc.

Deeply passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship, I am also very active in helping early-stage founders shape their ideas and find product market fit, by providing technical support and financial advisory. Book a slot for a quick chat on my <a href='https://calendly.com/isabella-y/15min'>calendar</a> if you have something exciting to share!

Most recent hobby: bouldering 🧗🏻‍♀️

# 💬 Reading Records
I am trying to read more books since 2024. To keep myself more motivated, I will list the books I have finished reading with some comments.
- ***Hit Refresh*: Empathy and culture** [Jan, 2024]

There are many summarized principles by Satya in this book on working and building company's culture. Satya has his very unique perception about empathy given his personal experiences. I am more curious about how he had climbed the ladder over time and what were the turning points in his career before he was given the chance and stage to lead.
- ***Notorious RBG*: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg** [Jan, 2024]
  
My eyes were wet multiple times when I saw how the world treated women decades ago. Rights are not given or granted, but fought for. It is also a fortune to have a supportive and spiritually fulfilling companion. We, as women, should always and never forget how the rights of us are here today. We need to protect it and support each other.
- **Steve Jobs** [Feb, 2024]
  
In this book, Jobs cried more than 20 times (or at least holding tears in his eyes). It is surprising to see how many times that Jobs showed his emotions even vulnerability bluntly, while he was admired and worshiped by the world as a hero. I honestly also cried once I started reading because I realized that I would never have a chance to talk to him in person regardless of how many familiarities I have found in myself and how profoundly I echo on his experiences. It is the greatest shame but I am also deeply grateful to read this book. I knew I was not the only one.
- **芯片浪潮** [April, 2024]
  
A thorough documentary of chips history. Very informative and useful in knowing the development of chips manufactory. The business acumen, competition war, and firm conviction all make this book a good read.
- **掌舵** [Jan, 2025]
  
Rich context of development of private companies and their relationships with governments in China. It is a bit surprising to me that many lessons / experiences shared in the book are no surprise to me that I take them for granted already. Even though I have never had the chance to practice any of these skills, it does seem so nature to me. Maybe it is what I have learned imperceptibly in the past few years in VC journey. It is science to work with code, but an art to work with people.
